write a shell script to
- create the skeletal directory structure
- download the python files into the scripts directory
- check for the pre-requisites
- set the path of the tools folder
- set the directory structure in the constants file

Inside the other tools folder, maintain the git links of all the tools & write a shell script to update them periodically
